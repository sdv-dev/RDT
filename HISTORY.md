# History

## 0.6.2 - 2021-12-28

This release adds a new `BayesGMMTransformer`. This transformer can be used to convert a numerical column into two
columns: a discrete column indicating the selected `component` of the GMM for each row, and a continuous column containing
the normalized value of each row based on the `mean` and `std` of the selected `component`. It is useful when the column being transformed
came from multiple distributions.

This release also adds multiple new methods to the `HyperTransformer` API. These allow for users to access the specfic
transformers used on each input field, as well as view the entire tree of transformers that are used when running `transform`.
The exact methods are:

* `BaseTransformer.get_input_columns()` - Return list of input columns for a transformer.
* `BaseTransformer.get_output_columns()` - Return list of output columns for a transformer.
* `HyperTransformer.get_transformer(field)` - Return the transformer instance used for a field.
* `HyperTransformer.get_output_transformers(field)` - Return dictionary mapping output columns of a field to the transformers used on them.
* `HyperTransformer.get_final_output_columns(field)` - Return list of all final output columns related to a field.
* `HyperTransformer.get_transformer_tree_yaml()` - Return YAML representation of transformers tree.

Additionally, this release fixes a bug where the `HyperTransformer` was incorrectly raising a `NotFittedError`. It also improved the
`DatetimeTransformer` by autonomously detecting if a column needs to be converted from `dtype` `object` to `dtype` `datetime`.

### New Features

## 0.6.1 - 2021-11-10

This release adds support for Python 3.9! It also removes unused document files.

### Internal Improvements

* Add support for Python 3.9 - Issue [#323](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT/issues/323) by @amontanez24
* Remove docs - PR [#322](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT/pull/322) by @pvk-developer

## 0.6.0 - 2021-10-29

This release makes major changes to the underlying code for RDT as well as the API for both the `HyperTransformer` and `BaseTransformer`.
The changes enable the following functionality:

* The `HyperTransformer` can now apply a sequence of transformers to a column.
* Transformers can now take multiple columns as an input.
* RDT has been expanded to allow for infinite data types to be added instead of being restricted to `pandas.dtypes`.
* Users can define acceptable output types for running `HyperTransformer.transform`.
* The `HyperTransformer` will continuously apply transformations to the input fields until only acceptable data types are in the output. 
* Transformers can return data of any data type.
* Transformers now have named outputs and output types.
* Transformers can suggest which transformer to use on any of their outputs.

To take advantage of this functionality, the following API changes were made:

* The `HyperTransformer` has new initialization parameters that allow users to specify data types for any field in their data as well as
specify which transformer to use for a field or data type. The parameters are:
    * `field_transformers` - A dictionary allowing users to specify which transformer to use for a field or derived field. Derived fields
    are fields created by running `transform` on the input data.
    * `field_data_types` - A dictionary allowing users to specify the data type of a field.
    * `default_data_type_transformers` - A dictionary allowing users to specify the default transformer to use for a data type.
    * `transform_output_types` - A dictionary allowing users to specify which data types are acceptable for the output of `transform`.
    This is a result of the fact that transformers can now be applied in a sequence, and not every transformer will return numeric data.
* Methods were also added to the `HyperTransformer` to allow these parameters to be modified. These include `get_field_data_types`,
`update_field_data_types`, `get_default_data_type_transformers`, `update_default_data_type_transformers` and `set_first_transformers_for_fields`.
* The `BaseTransformer` now requires the column names it will transform to be provided to `fit`, `transform` and `reverse_transform`.
* The `BaseTransformer` added the following method to allow for users to see its output fields and output types: `get_output_types`.
* The `BaseTransformer` added the following method to allow for users to see the next suggested transformer for each output field:
`get_next_transformers`. 

On top of the changes to the API and the capabilities of RDT, many automated checks and tests were also added to ensure that contributions
to the library abide by the current code style, stay performant and result in data of a high quality. These tests run on every push to the
repository. They can also be run locally via the following functions:

* `validate_transformer_code_style` - Checks that new code follows the code style.
* `validate_transformer_quality` - Tests that new transformers yield data that maintains relationships between columns.
* `validate_transformer_performance` - Tests that new transformers don't take too much time or memory.
* `validate_transformer_unit_tests` - Checks that the unit tests cover all new code, follow naming conventions and pass.
* `validate_transformer_integration` - Checks that the integration tests follow naming conventions and pass.
