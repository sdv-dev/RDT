**RDT** is a Python library used to transform data for data science libraries and preserve
the transformations in order to revert them as needed.

# Install

**RDT** is part of the **SDV** project and is automatically installed alongside it. For
details about this process please visit the [SDV Installation Guide](
https://sdv.dev/SDV/getting_started/install.html)

Optionally, **RDT** can also be installed as a standalone library using the following commands:

**Using `pip`:**

```bash
pip install rdt
```

**Using `conda`:**

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge rdt
```

For more installation options please visit the [RDT installation Guide](INSTALL.md)


# Quickstart

In this short series of tutorials we will guide you through a series of steps that will
help you getting started using **RDT** to transform columns, tables and datasets.

## Transforming a column

In this first guide, you will learn how to use **RDT** in its simplest form, transforming
a single column loaded as a `pandas.DataFrame` object.

### 1. Load the demo data

You can load some demo data using the `rdt.get_demo` function, which will return some random
data for you to play with.

```python3
from rdt import get_demo

data = get_demo()
```

This will return a `pandas.DataFrame` with 5 rows and 5 columns, one of each data type supported:

```
  last_login email_optin credit_card  age  dollars_spent
0 2021-06-26       False        VISA   29          99.99
1 2021-02-10       False        VISA   18            NaN
2        NaT       False        AMEX   21           2.50
3 2020-09-26        True         NaN   45          25.00
4 2020-12-22         NaN    DISCOVER   32          19.99
```

Notice that RDT may introduce some null values randomly.

### 2. Load the transformer

In this example we will use the datetime column, so let's load a `UnixTimestampEncoder`.

```python3
from rdt.transformers import UnixTimestampEncoder

transformer = UnixTimestampEncoder()
```

### 3. Fit the Transformer

Before being able to transform the data, we need the transformer to learn from it.

We will do this by calling its `fit` method passing the column that we want to transform.

```python3
transformer.fit(data, column='last_login')
```

### 4. Transform the data

Once the transformer is fitted, we can pass the data again to its `transform` method in order
to get the transformed version of the data.

```python3
transformed = transformer.transform(data)
```

The output will be a `pandas.DataFrame` with two added columns, `last_login.value` containing 
the datetimes transformed to integer timestamps, and `last_login.is_null` indicating with 1s
which values were null in the original data.

```
  email_optin credit_card  age  dollars_spent  last_login.value  last_login.is_null
0       False        VISA   29          99.99      1.624666e+18                 0.0
1       False        VISA   18            NaN      1.612915e+18                 0.0
2       False        AMEX   21           2.50      1.611814e+18                 1.0
3        True         NaN   45          25.00      1.601078e+18                 0.0
4         NaN    DISCOVER   32          19.99      1.608595e+18                 0.0
```

### 5. Revert the column transformation

In order to revert the previous transformation, the transformed data can be passed to
the `reverse_transform` method of the transformer:

```python3
reversed_data = transformer.reverse_transform(transformed)
```

The output will be a `pandas.DataFrame` containing the reverted values, which should be exactly
like the original ones, except for the order of the columns.

```
  email_optin credit_card  age  dollars_spent last_login
0       False        VISA   29          99.99 2021-06-26
1       False        VISA   18            NaN 2021-02-10
2       False        AMEX   21           2.50        NaT
3        True         NaN   45          25.00 2020-09-26
4         NaN    DISCOVER   32          19.99 2020-12-22
```

## Transforming a table

Once we know how to transform a single column, we can try to go the next level and transform
a table with multiple columns.

### 1. Load the HyperTransformer

In order to manuipulate a complete table we will need to load a `rdt.HyperTransformer`.

```python3
from rdt import HyperTransformer

ht = HyperTransformer()
```

### 2. Fit the HyperTransformer

Just like the transfomer, the HyperTransformer needs to be fitted before being able to transform
data.

This is done by calling its `fit` method passing the `data` DataFrame.

```python3
ht.fit(data)
```

### 3. Transform the table data

Once the HyperTransformer is fitted, we can pass the data again to its `transform` method in order
to get the transformed version of the data.

```python3
transformed = ht.transform(data)
```

The output will be another `pandas.DataFrame` with the numerical representation of our data.

```
   last_login.value  last_login.is_null  email_optin.value  email_optin.is_null  credit_card.value  age.value  dollars_spent.value  dollars_spent.is_null
0      1.624666e+18                 0.0                0.0                  0.0           0.203204         29                99.99                    0.0
1      1.612915e+18                 0.0                0.0                  0.0           0.117002         18                36.87                    1.0
2      1.611814e+18                 1.0                0.0                  0.0           0.502184         21                 2.50                    0.0
3      1.601078e+18                 0.0                1.0                  0.0           0.734610         45                25.00                    0.0
4      1.608595e+18                 0.0               -1.0                  1.0           0.883881         32                19.99                    0.0
```

### 4. Revert the table transformation

In order to revert the transformation and recover the original data from the transformed one,
we need to call `reverse_transform` method of the `HyperTransformer` instance passing it the
transformed data.

```python3
reversed_data = ht.reverse_transform(transformed)
```

Which should output, again, a table that looks exactly like the original one.

```
  last_login email_optin credit_card  age  dollars_spent
0 2021-06-26       False        VISA   29          99.99
1 2021-02-10       False        VISA   18            NaN
2        NaT       False        AMEX   21           2.50
3 2020-09-26        True         NaN   45          25.00
4 2020-12-22        <NA>    DISCOVER   32          19.99
```
