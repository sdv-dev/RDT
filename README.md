## Overview

**RDT** is a Python library used to transform data for data science libraries and preserve
the transformations in order to revert them as needed.

# Install

## Requirements

**RDT** has been developed and tested on [Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
on GNU/Linux, macOS and Windows systems.

Also, although it is not strictly required, the usage of a [virtualenv](
https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is highly recommended in order to avoid
interfering with other software installed in the system where **RDT** is run.

## Install with pip

The easiest and recommended way to install **RDT** is using [pip](
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```bash
pip install rdt
```

This will pull and install the latest stable release from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/).

If you want to install from source or contribute to the project please read the
[Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.rst).

## Install with conda

**RDT** can also be installed using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):

```bash
conda install -c sdv-dev -c conda-forge rdt
```

This will pull and install the latest stable release from [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/).


# Quickstart

In this short series of tutorials we will guide you through a series of steps that will
help you getting started using **RDT** to transform columns, tables and datasets.

## Transforming a column

In this first guide, you will learn how to use **RDT** in its simplest form, transforming
a single column loaded as a `pandas.DataFrame` object.

### 1. Load the demo data

You can load some demo data using the `rdt.get_demo` function, which will return some random
data for you to play with.

```python3
from rdt import get_demo

data = get_demo()
```

This will return a `pandas.DataFrame` with 10 rows and 4 columns, one of each data type supported:

```
   0_int    1_float 2_str          3_datetime
0   38.0  46.872441     b 2021-02-10 21:50:00
1   77.0  13.150228   NaN 2021-07-19 21:14:00
2   21.0        NaN     b                 NaT
3   10.0  37.128869     c 2019-10-15 21:39:00
4   91.0  41.341214     a 2020-10-31 11:57:00
5   67.0  92.237335     a                 NaT
6    NaN  51.598682   NaN 2020-04-01 01:56:00
7    NaN  42.204396     c 2020-03-12 22:12:00
8   68.0        NaN     c 2021-02-25 16:04:00
9    7.0  31.542918     a 2020-07-12 03:12:00
```

Notice how the data is random, so your output might look a bit different. Also notice how
RDT introduced some null values randomly.

### 2. Load the transformer

In this example we will use the datetime column, so let's load a `DatetimeTransformer`.

```python3
from rdt.transformers import DatetimeTransformer

transformer = DatetimeTransformer()
```

### 3. Fit the Transformer

Before being able to transform the data, we need the transformer to learn from it.

We will do this by calling its `fit` method passing the column that we want to transform.

```python3
transformer.fit(data['3_datetime'])
```

### 4. Transform the data

Once the transformer is fitted, we can pass the data again to its `transform` method in order
to get the transformed version of the data.

```python3
transformed = transformer.transform(data['3_datetime'])
```

The output will be a `numpy.ndarray` with two columns, one with the datetimes transformed
to integer timestamps, and another one indicating with 1s which values were null in the
original data.

```
array([[1.61299380e+18, 0.00000000e+00],
       [1.62672924e+18, 0.00000000e+00],
       [1.59919923e+18, 1.00000000e+00],
       [1.57117554e+18, 0.00000000e+00],
       [1.60414542e+18, 0.00000000e+00],
       [1.59919923e+18, 1.00000000e+00],
       [1.58570616e+18, 0.00000000e+00],
       [1.58405112e+18, 0.00000000e+00],
       [1.61426904e+18, 0.00000000e+00],
       [1.59452352e+18, 0.00000000e+00]])
```

### 5. Revert the column transformation

In order to revert the previous transformation, the transformed data can be passed to
the `reverse_transform` method of the transformer:

```python3
reversed_data = transformer.reverse_transform(transformed)
```

The output will be a `pandas.Series` containing the reverted values, which should be exactly
like the original ones.

dtype: datetime64[ns]
```

## Transforming a table

Once we know how to transform a single column, we can try to go the next level and transform
a table with multiple columns.

### 1. Load the HyperTransformer

In order to manuipulate a complete table we will need to load a `rdt.HyperTransformer`.

```python3
from rdt import HyperTransformer

ht = HyperTransformer()
```

### 2. Fit the HyperTransformer

Just like the transfomer, the HyperTransformer needs to be fitted before being able to transform
data.

This is done by calling its `fit` method passing the `data` DataFrame.

```python3
ht.fit(data)
```

### 3. Transform the table data

Once the HyperTransformer is fitted, we can pass the data again to its `transform` method in order
to get the transformed version of the data.

```python3
transformed = ht.transform(data)
```

The output, will now be another `pandas.DataFrame` with the numerical representation of our
data.

```

```

### 4. Revert the table transformation

In order to revert the transformation and recover the original data from the transformed one,
we need to call `reverse_transform` method of the `HyperTransformer` instance passing it the
transformed data.

```python3
reversed_data = ht.reverse_transform(transformed)
```

Which should output, again, a table that looks exactly like the original one.

```
   0_int    1_float 2_str          3_datetime
0   38.0  46.872441     b 2021-02-10 21:50:00
1   77.0  13.150228   NaN 2021-07-19 21:14:00
