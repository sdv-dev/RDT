    Function to test the performance of specified transformers.

    This function will loop through the provided transformers

    test cases to run. It will then execute those tests.

        transformers (list):
            A list of transformer classes to test.
        sizes (list):
            A list of sizes to use for the generated datasets. Each
            size should be an int of how many rows that dataset should
            have.
