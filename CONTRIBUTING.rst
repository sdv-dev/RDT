Contributing to RDT
-------------------

Setting Up a Local Development Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Fork the `Reversible Data Transforms` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/RDT.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed,
   this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv RDT
    $ cd RDT/
    $ make install-develop

4. Claim or file an issue on GitHub. If there is already an issue on GitHub for the
   contribution you wish to make, claim it. If not, please file an issue and then claim
   it before creating a branch.

5. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b issue-[issue-number]-description-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   The naming scheme for your branch should have a prefix of the format ``issue-X``
   where X is the associated issue's number (eg. ``issue-123-fix-foo-bug``). If you
   are not developing on your own fork, further prefix the branch with your GitHub
   username, like ``githubusername/gh-123-fix-foo-bug``.

   Now you can make your changes locally.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-branch

Code Style
~~~~~~~~~~

RDT follows certain coding style guidelines. Any change made should conform to these
guidelines. RDT using the following third party libraries to check the code style.

* flake8::

    $ flake8 rdt
    $ flake8 tests --ignore=D

* isort::

    $ isort -c --recursive rdt tests

* pylint::

    $ pylint rdt tests/performance --rcfile=setup.cfg

* pydocstyle::

    $ pydocstyle rdt
    $ pydocstyle tests

To run all of the code style checks in RDT, use the following command::

    $ make lint

or if you are developing on Windows you can use::

    $ invoke lint

Unit Test Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There should be unit tests created specifically for any changes you add.
The unit tests are expected to cover 100% of your contribution's code based on the
coverage report. All the Unit Tests should comply with the following requirements:

1. Unit Tests should be based only in unittest and pytest modules.

2. The tests that cover a module called ``rdt/path/to/a_module.py`` should be implemented
   in a separated module called ``tests/unit/path/to/test_a_module.py.`` Note that the module
   name has the ``test_`` prefix and is located in a path similar to the one of the tested
   module, just inside the tests folder.

3. Each method of the tested module should have at least one associated test method, and
   each test method should cover only **one** use case or scenario.

4. Test case methods should start with the ``test_`` prefix and have descriptive names
   that indicate which scenario they cover.
   Names such as ``test_some_method_input_none``, ``test_some_method_value_error`` or
   ``test_some_method_timeout`` are good, but names like ``test_some_method_1``,
   ``some_method`` or ``test_error`` are not.

5. Each test should validate only what the code of the method being tested does, and not
   cover the behavior of any third party package or tool being used, which is assumed to
   work properly as far as it is being passed the right values.

6. Any third party tool that may have any kind of random behavior, such as some Machine
   Learning models, databases or Web APIs, will be mocked using the ``mock`` library, and
   the only thing that will be tested is that our code passes the right values to them.

7. Unit tests should not use anything from outside the test and the code being tested. This
   includes not reading or writing to any file system or database, which will be properly
   mocked.

To run the test suite in RDT locally, use the following command::

    $ make test

or if you are developing on Windows, use::

    $ invoke test

.. _Pull Request Guidelines:

Pull Request Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. It resolves an open GitHub Issue and contains its reference in the title or
   the comment. If there is no associated issue, feel free to create one.
2. Whenever possible, it resolves only **one** issue. If your PR resolves more than
   one issue, try to split it in more than one pull request.
3. The pull request should include unit tests that cover all the changed code.
4. The pull request should work for all the supported Python versions. Check the `Github actions
   page`_ and make sure that all the checks pass.

Contributing a New Transformer
------------------------------

In addition to the guidelines mentioned above, there are extra steps that need to be taken
when adding a new ``Transformer`` class. They are described in detail in this section.

Transformer Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When contributing a new transformer, the most obvious requirement is creating the new Transformer
class. The class should inherit from `BaseTransformer` or one of its child classes.
There are only three required methods for a transformer:

1. ``_fit(data: pd.DataFrame)``: Used to store and learn any values from the input data that
   might be useful for the transformer.
2. ``_transform(data: pd.DataFrame)``: Used to transform the input data into completely numeric
   data. This method should not modify the internal state of the Transformer instance.
3. ``_reverse_transform(data: pd.DataFrame)``: Used to convert data that is completely numeric
   back into the format of the fitted data. This method should not modify the internal state of
   the Transformer instance.

Each transformer class should be placed inside the ``rdt/transformers`` folder, in a module
file named after the data type that the transformer operates on. The data
types used by RDT are called ``sdtypes``, and you can think of them as representing the **semantic**
or **statistical** meaning of a datatype. For example, if you are writing a transformer that works
with ``categorical`` data, your transformer should be placed inside the
``rdt/transformers/categorical.py`` module.

For more detailed guide on writing transformers, refer to the `Development Guide`_.

On top of adding the new class, unit tests must be written to cover all of the methods the new
class uses. In some cases, integration tests may also be required. More details on this can be
found below.

If the transformer adds a previously unsupported `sdtype` to RDT, then more steps will need
to be taken for performance tests. A new `DatasetGenerator` class may need to be created for
the `sdtype`. More details for these steps can be found below in the `Transformer Performance`_
section.

Transformer Validations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _Code Style:

Code Style
""""""""""

The code added for the new transformer must abide by the code style used in RDT. In addition,
there are custom code style requirements that must also be met. These mostly have to do with
class and method naming conventions. For example, all transformer classes must ened in
``Transformer``. They also have to inherit from the ``rdt.transformers.BaseTransformer`` class.

Validating Code Style
*********************

To validate the overall code style for your transformer, you can use the custom code validation
function, ``validate_transformer_code_style``. This function returns a boolean indicating whether
or not the transformer passed all the code style checks. It also prints a table describing each
check and whether or not it passed.

.. code-block:: Python

   In [1]: from tests.contributing import validate_transformer_code_style

   In [2]: valid = validate_transformer_code_style('rdt.transformers.BinaryEncoder') # Replace BinaryEncoder with your transformer
   Validating source file C:\Datacebo\RDT\rdt\transformers\boolean.py

   In [3]: valid
   Out[3]: True

Unit Tests
""""""""""

* Unit tests should cover specific cases for each of the following methods: ``__init__``,
  ``fit``, ``transform`` and ``reverse_transform``.
* Unit tests for a transformer must have 100% coverage based on the code coverage report.
* The tests should go in a module called ``tests/unit/transformers/{transformer_module}``.

Validating Unit Tests
*********************

The transformer unit tests and their coverage can be validated using the
``validate_transformer_unit_tests`` function. This function returns a ``float`` value representing
the test coverage where 1.0 is 100%. It also prints each test and whether or not it passed. It also
prints a table summarizing the test coverage and provides a link to the full coverage report.

Integration Tests
"""""""""""""""""

Integration tests should test the entire workflow of going from input data, to fitting, to
transforming and finally reverse transforming the data. By default, we run integration tests
for each transformer that validate the following checks:

1. The Transformer correctly defines the sdtype that it supports.
2. At least one Dataset Generator exists for the Transformer sdtype.
3. The Transformer can transform data and produces outputs of the indicated sdtypes.
4. The Transformer can reverse transform the data it produces, recovering the original sdtype.
5. The HyperTransformer is able to use the Transformer and produce float values.
6. The HyperTransformer is able to reverse the data that has previously transformed,
   and restore the original sdtype.

If you wish to test any specific end-to-end scenarios that were not covered in the above checks, 
add a new integration test. Integration tests can be added under
``tests/integration/path/to/test_a_module.py``.

* Before putting up a PR, confirm that the automatic integration tests pass. If new functionality
  that isn't covered is added, feel free to add new integration tests.
* Integration tests should be added under ``tests/unit/transformers/{transformer_module}``.

Validating Integration Tests
****************************

Integration tests can be validated using the ``validate_transformer_integration`` function. This
function returns a boolean representing whether or not the transformer passes all integration
checks. It also prints a table describing each check and whether or not it passed.

.. _Transformer Performance:

Transformer Performance
"""""""""""""""""""""""

We want to ensure our transformers are as efficient as possible, in terms of time and memory.
In order to do so, we run performance tests on each transformer, based on the input sdtype
specified by the transformer.

We generate test data using Dataset Generators. Each transformer should have at least one
Dataset Generator that produces data of the transformer's input sdtype.
If there are any specific dataset characteristics that you think may affect your transformer
performance (e.g. constant data, mostly null data), consider adding a Dataset Generator
for that scenario as well.

.. _Creating Dataset Generators:

Creating Dataset Generators
***************************

In order to test performance, we have a class that is responsible for generating data to test
the transformer methods against. Each subclass implements two static methods, ``generate`` 
and ``get_performance_thresholds``.

1. ``generate`` takes in the number of rows to generate, and outputs the expected number
   of data rows.
2. ``get_performance_thresholds`` returns the time and memory threshold for each of the required
   transformer methods. These thresolds are per row.

You should make a generator for every type of column that you believe would be useful to test
against. For some examples, you can look in the `dataset generator folder`_.

The generators each have a ``SDTYPE`` class variable. This should match the sdtype that your
``transformer`` accepts as input.

More details can be found in the `Development Guide`_.

Common Performance Pitfalls
***************************

It is important to keep the performance of these transformers as efficient as possible.
Below are some tips and common pitfalls to avoid when developing your transformer, so as to
optimize performance.

1. Avoid duplicate operations. If you need to do some change to an array/series, try to only
   do it once and reuse that variable later.
2. Try to use vectorized operations when possible.
3. When working with Pandas Series, a lot of the operations are able to handle nulls. If you
   need to round, get the max or get the min of a series, there is no need to filter out nulls
   before doing that calculation.
4. ``pd.to_numeric`` is preferred over ``as_type``.
5. ``pd.to_numeric`` also replaces all None values with NaNs that can be operated on since
   ``np.nan`` is a float type.
6. If you are working with a series that has booleans and null values, there is a
   `nullable boolean type`_ that can be leveraged to avoid having to filter out null values.

Validating Performance
**********************

Validate the performance of your transformer using the ``validate_transformer_performance``
function. This function returns a ``pandas.DataFrame`` containing the performance results
of the transformer.

.. code-block:: Python

   In [1]: from tests.contributing import validate_transformer_performance

   In [2]: results = validate_transformer_performance('rdt.transformers.UnixTimestampEncoder') # Replace UnixTimestampEncoder with your transformer
   Validating Performance for transformer UnixTimestampEncoder

   SUCCESS: The Performance Tests were successful.

   In [3]: results
   Out [3]:

Fix any performance issues that are reported. If there are no errors but performance
can be improved, this function should be used for reference.

Finalize Your Transformer
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

Re-run all the previous validations until they pass. For a final verification, run
``validate_pull_request`` and fix any errors reported. This function runs all the checks described
above. It also prints a table summarizing the results of all these checks.

.. code-block:: Python

   In [1]: from tests.contributing import validate_pull_request

   In [2]: valid = validate_pull_request('rdt.transformers.BinaryEncoder') # Replace BinaryEncoder with your transformer
